# categories for novel beginning analysis
This document explains the categories and their possible values used for the novel beginning analysis. The analysis results are saved in `categorization.tsv`.

## grammatical person
The grammatical person is determined on the basis of expressions in relation to the extradiegetic narrator as far as this instance appears in the first chapter. It is an indication of the narrator's role in the speech situation of the narration.

Possible values:
- 1st
- (2nd)
- 3rd

## narrator
This category refers to the personal relationship of the extradiegetic narrator to the diegesis of his narrative according to Genette.

Possible values:
- heterodiegetic
- homodiegetic

## discourse
Expositionality is the degree of communication of basic information about the plot, historical context, place, time and setting according to Krings (2004). The assessment of expositionality refers to the entire first chapter and it is basically a comparative value. Since basic information can be communicated in various ways in the narration, for example as a description of space or en passant in the course of the presentation of events in the plot, it is irrelevant for the degree of expositionality whether and when the plot is presented in the first chapter or not.

Possible values:
- low expositionality
- medium expositionality
- high expositionality

## story
At the level of the story, based on Horace, we distinguish between “ab ovo” and “in medias res” openings, i.e. between the fact that the first chapter presents events that are part of the plot and the fact that events are presented that belong to a side story or pre-story. This categorization also applies to the entire first chapter. So if, for example, after a longer section of preface or spatial description, plot-relevant action begins in the first chapter, we classify the whole chapter as “in medias res”. The “first character event” serves as an instrument for further distinguishing between different “in medias res” openings in this sense.

Possible values:
- in medias res
- ab ovo

## first character event
By this we understand character-related events in the sense of the event understanding according to Vauth and Gius (2021). The character has to be individually named by the text and relevant to the plot, i.e. the character is either themself part of the plot of the narration or at least interacts with characters in the plot. The *first character event* does not have to be part of the plot itself: the decisive factor for the categorization is the relationship of the character to the plot, not the relationship of the event to the plot.
