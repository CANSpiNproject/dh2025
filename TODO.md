# TODOs before release

- add first event data to `/results/visualizations`:
    - all relations to cs1 annotations
- add get first character event cs1 relations to notebook
- update README as soon as gitma-CANSpiN v1.6.4 release is published: gitma-CANSpiN v1.6.4 is necessary for executing the notebook

Finally: move tag `v1.0.0` to the last commit, create Release, and change commit ID in `CITATION.cff` after that.
